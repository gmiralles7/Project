# X-Rays

In this experiment, we will focus on photons in the x-ray range. These photons are typically produced from electronic transitions. X-rays range in energy from 10s of eV up to 10s or 100s of keV.

Experimentally, we will study x-ray spectra in two ways:

By using a proportional counter to directly measure the energy of the photons (in analogy to the way we used a NaI+PMT detector to measure gammas); and
By using Bragg scattering to obtain finer energy resolution through diffraction of x-rays off of a crystal lattice.
Pedagogically, we will study x-ray creation from two sources:

-x-rays produced when we strike a target with high energy electrons; and
-x-rays produced when we strike a target with high energy x-rays.
